								<div><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> <p>MIDUS Core Mortality</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>In 1995-1996, the MacArthur Midlife Research Network carried out a national survey of over 7,000 Americans aged 25 to 74 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR02760">ICPSR 2760</a>). The purpose of the study was to investigate the role of behavioral, psychological, and social factors in understanding age-related differences in physical and mental health.</p>
<p>With support from the National Institute on Aging, an initial follow-up of the original Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) samples was conducted in 2004 (MIDUS 2). The daily stress and cognitive functioning projects were repeated at MIDUS 2; in addition the protocol was expanded to include biomarkers and neuroscience. In 2005, a baseline sample of 592 African Americans from Milwaukee was added to MIDUS to examine health issues in minority populations.</p>
<p>In 2013, a third wave (MIDUS 3) of survey data was collected on longitudinal participants. Data collection for this follow-up wave largely repeated baseline assessments (e.g., phone interview and extensive self-administered questionnaire), with additional questions in selected areas (e.g., economic recession experiences, optimism and coping, stressful life events, and caregiving). A third wave of cognitive functioning data and a second wave of the Milwaukee sample were also collected. Data collection for the daily diary, biomarkers, and neuroscience is ongoing. This dataset includes all known MIDUS decedents (N=2,533) from the Core National and Milwaukee samples as of December 2023.</p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The primary purpose of this study was to obtain information about the underlying cause of death for Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) and Milwaukee decedents.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> 2,533 prior participants in the MIDUS series with a confirmed decedent status.</span></p>
								<div><strong>Time Method:</strong> <p>Longitudinal</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> All decedent participants of the MIDUS series.</span></p>
								<div><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> <p>Individual</p></div>
								<div><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> <p>administrative records data</p></div>
								<div><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> <p>record abstracts</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Description of Variables:</strong> <p>The data set contains 55 variables and 2,533 cases. The variables include decedent status, source of decedent information, month and year of death, and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes.</p>
<p>The demographic variable, sex, is also included.</p></span></p>
